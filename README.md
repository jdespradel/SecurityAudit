<h1>Security Audit</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive security audit for a fictional company named Botium Toys. This involved defining the audit's scope, assessing potential risks, carrying out the audit itself, and devising a plan to address any identified vulnerabilities. By systematically examining Botium Toys' security measures, I provided clear insights and actionable recommendations to bolster its defenses against potential threats.
